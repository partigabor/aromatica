  {"id":"abdel-maksoud_2011_review","abstract":"Mummification is considered one of the most important in the history of ancient Egyptian civilization. The artificial mummification process started in the Fourth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom reached its peak in the New Kingdom. This review focuses on the usage of mummification materials such as Natron salt, Coniferous resin, Mastic, Myrrh, Beeswax, Bitumen, Cassia, Onions, Lichen, Henna and Gum Arabic in ancient Egypt to determine their effectiveness in the preservation of the body. For each material, the chemical formula, the history, and the role in the preservation of the body are presented. It is shown that natron salt was the most important material to desiccate a corpse, and that the vegetable materials mentioned above have anti-bacterial properties that protected the body from microbial attack.","author":[{"family":"Abdel-Maksoud","given":"Gomaa"},{"family":"El-Amin","given":"Abdel-Rahman"}],"citation-key":"abdel-maksoud_2011_review","container-title":"Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"129-150","title":"A review on the materials used during the mummification processes in ancient Egypt","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"aftel_2014_fragrant","abstract":"The 'Alice Waters of American natural perfume' (indieperfume.com) celebrates our most potent sense, through five rock stars of the fragrant world. Mandy Aftel is widely acclaimed as a trailblazer in natural perfumery. Over two decades of sourcing the finest aromatic ingredients from all over the world and creating artisanal fragrances, she has been an evangelist for the transformative power of scent. In Fragrant, through five major players in the epic of aroma, she explores the profound connection between our sense of smell and the appetites that move us, give us pleasure, make us fully alive. Cinnamon, queen of the Spice Route, touches our hunger for the unknown, the exotic, the luxurious. Mint, homegrown the world over, speaks to our affinity for the familiar, the native, the authentic. Frankincense, an ancient incense ingredient, taps into our longing for transcendence, while ambergris embodies our unquenchable curiosity. And exquisite jasmine exemplifies our yearning for beauty, both evanescent and enduring. In addition to providing a riveting initiation into the history, natural history, and philosophy of scent, Fragrant imparts the essentials of scent literacy and includes recipes for easy-to-make fragrances and edible, drinkable, and useful concoctions that reveal the imaginative possibilities of creating with'and reveling in'aroma.

  {"id":"ager_2022_scent","abstract":"Magic was a fundamental part of the Greco-Roman world. Curses, erotic spells, healing charms, divination, and other supernatural methods of trying to change the universe were everyday methods of coping with the difficulties of life in antiquity. While ancient magic is most often studied through texts like surviving Greco-Egyptian spellbooks and artifacts like lead curse tablets, for a Greek or Roman magician a ritual was a rich sensual experience full of unusual tastes, smells, textures, and sounds, bright colors, and sensations like fasting and sleeplessness. Greco-Roman magical rituals were particularly dominated by the sense of smell, both fragrant smells and foul odors. Ritual practitioners surrounded themselves with clouds of fragrant incense and perfume to create a sweet and inviting atmosphere for contact with the divine and to alter their own perceptions; they also used odors as an instrumental weapon to attack enemies and command the gods. Elsewhere, odiferous herbs were used equally as medical cures and magical ingredients. In literature, scent and magic became intertwined as metaphors, with fragrant spells representing the dangers of sensual perfumes and conversely, smells acting as a visceral way of envisioning the mysterious action of magic The Scent of Ancient Magic explores the complex interconnection of scent and magic in the Greco-Roman world between 800 BCE and CE 600, drawing on ancient literature and the modern study of the senses to examine the sensory depth and richness of ancient magic. Author Britta K. Ager looks at how ancient magicians used scents as part of their spells, to put themselves in the right mindset for an encounter with a god or to attack their enemies through scent. Ager also examines the magicians who appear in ancient fiction, like Medea and Circe, and the more metaphorical ways in which their spells are confused with perfumes and herbs. This book brings together recent scholarship on ancient magic from classical studies and on scent from the interdisciplinary field of sensory studies in order to examine how practicing ancient magicians used scents for ritual purposes, how scent and magic were conceptually related in ancient literature and culture, and how the assumption that strong scents convey powerful effects of various sorts was also found in related areas like ancient medical practices and normative religious ritual.","author":[{"family":"Ager","given":"Britta K."}],"call-number":"BF1591","citation-key":"ager_2022_scent","contributor":[{"literal":"Michigan Publishing (University of Michigan)"}],"event-place":"Ann Arbor, Michigan","ISBN":"978-0-472-22007-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor, Michigan","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The scent of ancient magic","type":"book"},

Yet these same officials gave official titles to Chinese pirates as part of a \"summon and appease\" (zhaofu) policy in the hope that the pirates would abandon crime for more civilized pursuits. After a decade of frustrations, the Dutch decided to take a page from the pirates' playbook and tried to unite the pirates to attack China. The pirate war against China did not go well for the Dutch, who failed to unite the pirates under their leadership. Nonetheless, they did eventually reach a modus vivendi with Chinese officials and began trading regularly with China. Yet after the collapse of the Ming Empire in 1644, the Dutch increasingly suffered competition from an ex-pirate organization: the powerful Zheng family. Its leader, Zheng Chenggong, created a loyalist state with maritime pretensions. So long as the company was competing against private Chinese seamen who lacked state support, it was able to hold its own.

  {"id":"bagli_2021_tastes","abstract":"Taste is considered one of the lowest sensory modalities, and the most difficult to express in language. Recently, an increasing body of research in perception language and in Food Studies has been sparkling new interest and new perspectives on the importance of this sense. Merging anthropology, evolutionary physiology and philosophy, this book investigates the language of Taste in English, and its relationship with our embodied minds. In the first part of the book, the author explores the semantic dimensions of Taste terms with a usage-based approach. With the application of experimental protocols, Bagli enquires their possible organization in a radial network and calculates the Salience index of gustatory terms in both American and British English. The second part of the book is an overview of the metaphorical extensions that motivate the polysemy of Taste terms, with the aid of corpus analysis methods and various texts. This book is the first to review systematically and in a usage-based perspective the role of the sensory domain of Taste in English, showing a more complicated picture and suggesting that its under-representation and difficulty of encoding does not correspond to lack of importance.","author":[{"family":"Bagli","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"bagli_2021_tastes","event-place":"Berlin","ISBN":"978-3-11-062677-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"De Gruyter Mouton","publisher-place":"Berlin","title":"Tastes we live by: The linguistic conceptualisation of taste in English","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bartoshuk_1993_biological","abstract":"We have discarded the old tongue map (sweet on the tip, etc.) for study of the interactions among taste nerves. Taste is mediated by the chorda tympani (anterior) and the glossopharyngeal (posterior) nerves. Unilateral anesthesia of the chorda tympani intensified some taste sensations from the area innervated by the contralateral glossopharyngeal. For some subjects, even with no stimulation, a phantom taste sensation appeared in the area innervated by the contralateral glossopharyngeal nerve. Thus when one taste nerve is damaged another compensates; however, the cost may be a taste phantom. Work on genetic variation in taste has identified supertasters of PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil) who are unusually sensitive to bitters and sweets as well as the burn from chili pepper (active ingredient capsaicin). Supertasters appear to have more tastebuds and since tastebuds have trigeminal neurons (mediating pain) associated with them, there is an association between perception of taste and irritation.","author":[{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."}],"citation-key":"bartoshuk_1993_biological","container-title":"Food Quality and Preference","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0950-3293(93)90310-3","ISSN":"0950-3293","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"page":"21-32","title":"The Biological Basis of Food Perception and Acceptance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0950329393903103","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"bartoshuk_2012_taste","abstract":"Otitis media and tonsillectomy are associated with enhanced palatability of energy dense foods and with weight gain. Otitis media can damage the chorda tympani nerve (CN VII); tonsillectomy and head and neck radiation treatment can damage the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Both of these nerves function prominently in taste sensation. The present study utilizes these sources of damage to study central interactions among the nerves that mediate oral sensations. Mild damage restricted to one of these nerves can actually intensify sensations evoked from undamaged nerves (i.e., whole‐mouth taste, oral tactile sensations evoked by fats and irritants). These intensifications may result from disruption of central inhibitory taste circuits, as taste damage appears to disinhibit other oral sensory nerves. In addition, mild damage restricted to one taste nerve can intensify odors perceived from foods in the mouth during chewing and swallowing (i.e., retronasal olfaction); this may be a secondary consequence of the intensification of whole-mouth taste. Damage to both nerves leads to widespread oral sensory loss. At present, the link between sensory alterations and weight gain has not been established for adults (e.g., does increased fat preference occur in individuals with oral sensory intensifications, those with losses, or both?). Finally, pain in non-oral locations is also related to taste loss. When participants rated “the most intense pain of any kind they had ever experienced,” those with the greatest taste loss gave the highest ratings. These effects suggest that taste loss significantly influences long-term health outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."},{"family":"Catalanotto","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Howard"},{"family":"Logan","given":"Henrietta"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Derek J."}],"citation-key":"bartoshuk_2012_taste","container-title":"Physiology & Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.06.013","ISSN":"0031-9384","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"516-526","title":"Taste Damage (Otitis Media, Tonsillectomy and Head and Neck Cancer), Oral Sensations and BMI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938412002375","volume":"107"},

This dictionary is a treasure trove covering 2000 years of Ancient Greek: from Mycenaean via Homer and the classical period to lexicographers, such as Hesychius (5th century A.D.). It at last brings together all new data, resulting in scores of thoroughly revised etymologies.

Beginning at a period when an overland journey across the Malay Peninsula was an essential link in the routes connecting South, Southeast and East Asia, it is suggested that the ﬁrst entirely maritime itinerary to be used regularly passed through the Sunda Strait.

  {"id":"ming_2019_zheng","abstract":"In the history of the development of human civilization, the Silk Road has been an important route of traffic and exchange between the East and the West. From Zhang Qian’s 張騫 opening up of the Silk Road across the Western Regions (Xiyue 西域) to Zheng He’s 鄭和 sailing to the Western Oceans (xia xiyang 下西洋) more than 1500 years later, China had a continuous desire to explore beyond its borders. At the time of Zheng He, the term “Western Oceans” (xiyang 西 洋 ) had a specific meaning. As shown by the account of Ma Huan 馬歡, who personally joined Zheng He on the voyages, the people of Ming China considered the “Western Oceans” to be the Namoli Ocean (Namoli yang 那没黎洋), later called the Indian Ocean. Thus, it could be concluded that the Western Oceans where Zheng He’s fleet went meant the Indian Ocean. Even today most scholars still divide the Eastern and Western Oceans at Brunei, with no clear understanding of where the Western Oceans to which Zheng He sailed were actually located. It is therefore important to make clear that the Western Oceans in his time referred to the Indian Ocean, before moving on to investigate the purpose of the voyages and related historical issues. Even more important is to point out that Zheng He’s expeditions in the early fifteenth century reflected that Chinese people took to the seas on a scale larger than ever before and joined the maritime and overland silk routes together.

Drawing on his own family's history as spice traders, as well as travel narratives, historical accounts, and his expertise as an ethnobotanist, Nabhan describes the critical roles that Semitic peoples and desert floras had in setting the stage for globalized spice trade.Traveling along four prominent trade routes-the Silk Road, the Frankincense Trail, the Spice Route, and the Camino Real (for chiles and chocolate)-Nabhan follows the caravans of itinerant spice merchants from the frankincense-gathering grounds and ancient harbors of the Arabian Peninsula to the port of Zayton on the China Sea to Santa Fe in the southwest United States. His stories, recipes, and linguistic analyses of cultural diffusion routes reveal the extent to which aromatics such as cumin, cinnamon, saffron, and peppers became adopted worldwide as signature ingredients of diverse cuisines.<em>Cumin, Camels, and Caravans</em>demonstrates that two particular desert cultures often depicted in constant conflict-Arabs and Jews-have spent much of their history collaborating in the spice trade and suggests how a more virtuous multicultural globalized society may be achieved in the future.","author":[{"family":"Nabhan","given":"Gary Paul"}],"citation-key":"nabhan_2014_cumin","collection-title":"California Studies in Food and Culture","event-place":"Berkeley","ISBN":"978-0-520-26720-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"publisher":"University of California Press","publisher-place":"Berkeley","title":"Cumin, camels, and caravans: A spice odyssey","type":"book","URL":"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520379244/cumin-camels-and-caravans"},

  {"id":"sen_2019_zheng","abstract":"By examining the activities of Zheng He and members of his expeditions at the Malabar Coast, Sri Lanka, and Bengal, this article argues that the Yongle emperor wanted to exert military power in South Asia in order to legitimize his usurpation at the Ming court. The essay analyzes Zheng He’s intervention in the dispute between Calicut and Cochin, the armed conflict in Sri Lanka in 1410-11, and the expedition’s involvement in a dispute between Bengal and its neighboring polity, Jaunpur. These episodes in South Asia make it difficult to accept the modern representations of the Zheng He expeditions as diplomatic missions intended to promote peace and harmony. Rather, they were, as the essay contends, part of the Yongle emperor’s aim to establish hegemony over “all the known world under the Heaven” or the tianxia.","author":[{"family":"Sen","given":"Tansen"}],"citation-key":"sen_2019_zheng","container-title":"china and asia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Zheng He’s Military Interventions in South Asia","type":"article-journal"},
